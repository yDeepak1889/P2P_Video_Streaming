# Load balanced Multimedia Streaming in a Peer-to-Peer Network

In this project, we propose a peer-to-peer (p2p) network of smartphones which is built over WiFi through an android application. This p2p network of smart devices with different processing, storing capabilities can be used in several practical applications such as crowdsensing or it can be used as a distributed multimedia storage like BitTorrent. The application that we are targeting in this project is distribution of multimedia content in a load-balanced, distributed fashion.
